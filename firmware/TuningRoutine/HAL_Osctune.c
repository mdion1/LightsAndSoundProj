/* From the datasheet:
 * "The TUN bits default to a 6-bit, twoâ€™s compliment value of 0x00, which indicates that the oscillator is operating at the selected frequency. 
 * When a value between 0x01 and 0x1F is written to the TUN bits, the HFINTOSC frequency is increased.
 * When a value between 0x3F and 0x20 is written to the TUN bits, the HFINTOSC frequency is decreased."
